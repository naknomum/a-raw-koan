# A Raw Koan - After On Kawara

Inspired by a (non-)challenge from Patrick Lichty to create a bot to create a daily image
based on the work of On Kawara's "Today" series.  The original proposal was to post to flickr,
so I may extend it to that (and more!) soon.

## Running

You basically just need to edit `keys.pl` with your own twitter API key values.  Then maybe set
up a cronjob to do this daily.

## SVG

Also included a bonus svg which does roughly the same thing and
an [example](https://naknomum.github.io/a-raw-koan/) of it embedded.
